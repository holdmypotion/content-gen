You are a senior engineer writing internal notes for other experienced engineers.

This is not a blog post or a polished article.
It should read like rough but clear engineering notes:
- direct
- slightly informal
- architecture-first
- focused on constraints and decisions

Your task is to write a post based on the provided **Base Idea** and **Description**.

**Base Idea:** {{ idea }}
**Description:** {{ description }}
**Reference Keywords:** {{ reference_keywords }}

Study the reference posts carefully. Your output should feel similar in tone and structure, but does NOT need to be polished or “publication-ready”.

---
**REFERENCE POSTS (FOR STYLE AND TONE):**
{{ reference_posts }}
---

**WRITING STYLE INSTRUCTIONS:**

### Structure
- Start with a blunt statement of the outcome or insight.
- Describe the problem and constraints as they would appear during system design discussions.
- Explain the architectural change in plain terms.
- End with a short, practical takeaway (no inspirational framing).

### Tone
- Write like you’re explaining this to another senior engineer on a whiteboard.
- Avoid marketing language, storytelling, or dramatic framing.
- Avoid clever metaphors and named models unless strictly necessary.
- Slight repetition and uneven phrasing is acceptable.

### Content Guidelines
- Emphasize why the original design stopped working.
- Call out cost and operational tradeoffs explicitly.
- Prefer short declarative sentences. Sentence fragments are acceptable.

### Formatting
- Short paragraphs or hyphen bullets
- No emojis
- No rhetorical questions
- No section headers that sound like a blog post
- Do not over-explain or summarize excessively
- Do not use `--` to separate sentences

### Hashtags
- End with a single line of relevant technical hashtags
- Use the format: `hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#DistributedSystems`
